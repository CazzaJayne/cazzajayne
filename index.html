          <p>ON ROAD VEHICLE BREAKDOWN ASSISTANCE</p>
          <p>OVERVIEW: On Road Vehicle Breakdown Assistance is going to be a good solution for people who seek help in the remote locations with mechanical issues of their vehicles. Users of the On Road Vehicle Breakdown Assistance will be the registered public and they will be getting connected with the particular mechanic through the trustworthy on Road Vehicle Breakdown Assistance system because only the legally licensed and approved mechanics are enlisted in the On Road Vehicle Breakdown Assistance system.</p><br>
          <p>MOTIVATION: Breaking down by the side of the road is never convenient and statistics show that drivers worry about it while driving. From dead batteries to overheating engines, there are lots of things that can go wrong behind the wheel - leaving stranded people at the roadside everyday. While there's no denying that breaking down is an absolute pain no matter where or when it happens, there are certain situations in which roadside breakdowns can quickly turn from inconvenient into a full on nightmare.</p>
          <p>It doesn't matter where you're heading - if you've got children in the car you want to get there as quickly and safetly as possible. Breaking down in the middle of nowhere in the dark is a parent's nightmare - if you can get phone signal to call for help you still don't know how long you'll have to wait, and with traffic coming past you in the dark it can be a scary place to be.  Your car might not be in a safe place to stay inside it, but geting the family to sit in the dark by the road side is unappealing as well.</p><br>
          <p>DESCRIPTION</p>
          <p>USER: User has to register their basic details to get access with this application service. Once they have registered they need to login to avail the service at the needy time. Logging in with the application will provide them a list of mechanics that have approval of the application.  The user can search the mechanic among the list according to their place and time. After the process every user has to give their feedback.</p>
          <p>ADMINISTRATOR: Administration has to give approval to the registering mechanic after verifying their licensing details for the effective service.</p>
          <p>MECHANIC: At first every mechanic has to register their details with the admin for getting approval. Registered mechanics can login their accounts if they got their approval from admin.  Here mechanics have to post their details like name, location, services available etc.  Using the feedbacks provided by the users/customers of the service mechanics have to maintain or improve their service.</p><br>
          <p>TOOLS AND TECHNOLOGIES: Front End : HTML, CSS and Bootstarp : Back End : Angular JS, PHP, MYSQL</p><br>
          <p>OUTCOME: The outcome is the users of On Road Vehicle Breakdown Assistance system can search for list of mechanics at any location or the nearby locations which will help them in an unexpected situations by the mechanic being able to assist them over the phone with issues for their vehicles.  Hopefully the mechanic can provide assistance over the phone so the person with vehicle issues are able to get themselves out of the sticky situation and be able to get moving again to the closest town for more help. Breaking down is never fun but hopefully with the On Road Vehicle Breakdown Assistance the person can feel safer knowing that they always have assistance 24/7.</p>
